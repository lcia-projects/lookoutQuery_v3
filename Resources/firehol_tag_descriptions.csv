We do not recommend to use these data as a list of addresses that should be blocked but it can be used for example in analysis of the traffic in other networks.

zeus,"Abuse.ch Zeus tracker standard, contains the same data as the ZeuS IP blocklist (zeus_badips) but with the slight difference that it doesn't exclude hijacked websites (level 2) and free web hosting providers (level 3). This means that this blocklist contains all IPv4 addresses associated with ZeuS C&Cs which are currently being tracked by ZeuS Tracker. Hence this blocklist will likely cause some false positives."
zeus_badips,Abuse.ch Zeus tracker badips includes IPv4 addresses that are used by the ZeuS trojan. It is the recommened blocklist if you want to block only ZeuS IPs. It excludes IP addresses that ZeuS Tracker believes to be hijacked (level 2) or belong to a free web hosting provider (level 3). Hence the false postive rate should be much lower compared to the standard ZeuS IP blocklist.
